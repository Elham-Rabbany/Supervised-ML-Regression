## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values with imputation.
- Encoded categorical variables using ordinal and one-hot encoding.
- Scaled numerical features for consistency.

### Model Development
- Implemented regression models, including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Regressor**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **SGD Regressor**
- Tuned hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`.

### Model Evaluation
- Used metrics to assess performance:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
  - **R-squared (RÂ²)**
